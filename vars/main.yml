## finding the major version selected by the user :
## type : string
# the user will set either owncloud_version_major or owncloud_version_full
# to pin point a major/specific version.
# if owncloud_version_major is set it can have 3 values:
#   - 'master' : we just set an arbitrary high version (99)   -- used for daily
#   - a version number [M] : here's what we need. neat !
#   - stable[M] : just remove the 'stable' and here we go !
#     note: There is still a case when the user could use the master branch AND specify a very old date
#           and that whould make the computed major version inconsistent.
#           But I'm sure at 99.99% nobody wants to do that when using the daily channel.
# if owncloud_version_full is set, it always have the form [Major.minor.patch] version number. (M.m.p)
#   so the major version is the first element.
# if both variables are set we exclude the prerelease channel that do not use the major version on the first condition.
# if none are defined, either the user misconfigured the playbook that's calling the role
#   and the play should fail - so we won't manage this case here -
#   or owncloud_get_latest is true which is the equivalent for us of using "master"
